A few online Resources that I (Josh) have found helpful in learning Unity3D:

http://cgcookie.com/unity/
	
	Just finished up the "Getting Started with Unity"(http://cgcookie.com/unity/getting-started-with-unity/) section, which was fun.  
	
	Although the Tutorials are with Unity 3.4 not the 3.5 which is the current release, the tutorials are still easy to follow and get that basic understanding, 
	until it comes to Particles, which was a bit weird.  Found out how to do them though and have detailed that below:

In order to get the functions shown in the Tutorial go to GameObject then add an Empty GameObject, name it whatever.
The go to Component, Effects, Legacy Particles and add the Ellipsoid Particle Emitter, Particle Animator and Particle Renderer.  This will set up a Particle system
like the 3.4 game engine doesnt naturally.


I've heard that these videos are generally good, so incase CG Cookie isn't your thing, try these out:
